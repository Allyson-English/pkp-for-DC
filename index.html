                At its surface, local politics may seem less impactful than the national scene. After all, the ANC focuses on hyperlocal issues like street infrastructure and zoning. But history has shown time and again that real political change starts from the ground up. That’s why I’m running.

                <div id="env-box"><h4>Environment</h4><br>New construction projects are springing up all around our neighborhood, and we need to ensure that these new buildings are at the forefront of environmental sustainability. Additionally, we must devote adequate resources to incorporating green practices within existing infrastructure. Washington, DC has the potential to be one of the most environmentally-conscious places in the world, and we have a chance to contribute to that effort within our neighborhood.</div> 

                <div id="afh-box"><h4>Affordable Housing</h4><br>DC is already an expensive place to live and costs are continuing to rise. Without affordable housing, many existing residents are pushed out and high costs prevent new residents from moving in. As new businesses continue to expand into our area, housing costs continue to increase for residents in our neighborhood and communities across the city.  We must to address how these issues affect an already inadequate affordable housing situation.</div> 

                <div id="st-box"><h4>Statehood</h4><br>This is an issue that we need to continue to raise at every level of government. DC Statehood not only translates to meaningful federal representation for DC residents, but also unlocks significant access to federal resources we could use to create positive change for DC residents across our city. For example, without statehood, DC has been limited in its ability to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by federally-imposed rules and regulations—underscoring the need for action.</div>

                    Washington, DC is divided into eight different wards that are each represented by a member of the city council. Each ward is further subdivided into Advisory Neighborhood Commissions (ANCs), which are non-partisan volunteer positions that advise the city government on neighborhood issues. <br><br>

                    If you live in the Mount Vernon area, like I do, you are most likely part of Ward 6, ANC 6E. Each ANC is further divided into “Single Member Districts,” which each elect one Commissioner to represent them at the ANC. If you live in district 6E05, I am running to represent you. <br><br>

                      My goal is to build a strong relationship between the community and the ANC to ensure that our neighborhood’s voice is represented on the issues facing our city. To make meaningful progress on the local issues we care about we need a culture in which any resident feels empowered to get involved in community action and local government to express their thoughts and opinions.<br><br>
