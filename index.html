                <div id="env-box"><h4>Environment</h4> <br><br><p>Our neighborhood is rapidly developing with new construction and businesses. I want to ensure that the new buildings going up are at the forefront of environmental sustainability and that we devote adequate resources to incorporating green practices within existing infrastructure. Washington, DC has the potential to be one of the most environmentally-conscious places in the world, and we have a chance to contribute to that effort within our neighborhood. </p></div> 

                <div id="afh-box"><h4>Affordable Housing</h4> <br><br><p>DC is already an expensive place to live, and costs are continuing to rise, pushing existing residents and vulnerable populations out and high costs keeping potential new residents from coming in. A lack of supply of affordable housing in our city at a time when new businesses continue to expand into our area means increases in housing costs for residents in our neighborhood and communities across the city.  As we consider new developments in our neighborhood, we need to keep focus on how those developments affect an already tenuous affordable housing situation. </p></div> 

                <div id="st-box"><h4>Statehood</h4> <br><br><p>This is an issue that we need to continue to raise at every level of government. DC Statehood not only means meaningful federal representation for DC residents, but also unlocks significant access to federal resources we could use to create positive change for DC residents across our city. For example, in the case of the city’s response to COVID-19, DC has been limited in its ability to respond to the pandemic by federal-imposed rules and regulations – underscoring the need for action on statehood. </p></div>

                <div id="whyme_paragraph">I’m the son of two immigrants who came to the United States in search of better life. I’m motivated by the deep values that our country strives for, though I acknowledge that we have a ways to go to attain full justice and equality for all. That’s why I’m running. <br><br>Local politics may seem less exciting than the national scene. After all, an ANC Commissioner focuses on things like things like street infrastructure and zoning. But history has shown time and again that real political change starts from the bottom up.

                    Washington, DC is divided into eight different wards that are each represented by a member of the city council. Each ward is further subdivided into Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, which are non-partisan volunteer positions whose job it is to make recommendations to the city government on the way forward on hyperlocal issues: everything from zoning and housing to street infrastructure. <br><br>If you live in the Mount Vernon area, like I do, you are most likely part of Ward 6, ANC 6E. Each ANC is further divided into “Single Member Districts,” which each elect one Commissioner to represent them at the ANC. If you live in district 6E05, I am running to represent you.<br><br>
