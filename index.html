I’m someone who believes deeply in democracy and that the best policies come from the local level. I hope to use this platform to make a positive change in our community.</h3>

          <h2 style="padding-top: 1.25%;">What is the ANC?</h2>
          <h3 style="text-align: left; margin-top: 3%;">Washington, DC is divided into eight different wards that are each represented by a member of the city council. Each ward is further subdivided into Advisory Neighborhood Commissions. If you live in the Mount Vernon area, like I do, you are most likely part of Ward 6, ANC 6E. Each ANC is further divided into “Single Member Districts,” which each elect one Commissioner to represent them at the ANC. If you live in district 6E05, I am running to represent you. You can use this DC government link [LINK NEEDED] to verify within which ANC you fall.</h3>
