                <div id="whyme_paragraph">Thirty years ago, my parents came to the United States in search of a better life. Like many immigrants, they had a humble start in this country. Their economic struggle taught me the value of hard work, but it also helped me see the need for strong institutions and good government. Our country’s values motivate me, though I understand we have a long road to justice and equality for all.

                At its surface, local politics may seem less impactful than the national scene. After all, the ANC focuses on hyperlocal issues like street infrastructure and zoning. But these topics affect our daily lives and have an important role in how our community is shaped. History has shown time and again that real political change builds from the ground up. That’s why I’m running for the ANC.

                <div id="env-box"><h4>Environment</h4><br>New construction projects are springing up all around our neighborhood and we need to ensure that new development is sustainable for generations to come. Additionally, we must devote adequate resources to incorporating green practices within existing infrastructure. Washington, DC has the potential to be one of the most environmentally conscious places in the world. We have the chance to contribute to that effort within our neighborhood.</div> 

                <div id="afh-box"><h4>Affordable Housing</h4><br>DC is one of the most expensive places to live in the country and costs are continuing to rise. Without affordable housing, many existing residents are pushed out and high costs prevent new residents from moving in. As new businesses continue to expand into our area, housing costs continue to increase for residents in our neighborhood and communities across the city.  We must to address how these issues affect an already inadequate affordable housing situation.</div> 

                <div id="st-box"><h4>Statehood</h4><br>Statehood means funding, resources, and, most of all, representation. This is an issue that we need to continue to raise at every level of government. DC Statehood not only translates to meaningful federal representation for DC residents, but also unlocks significant access to resources we could use to create positive change for neighborhoods across our city. For example, without statehood, DC has been limited in its ability to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic – underscoring the need for action.</div>

                    Washington, DC is divided into eight different wards that are each represented by a member of the city council. Each ward is further subdivided into Advisory Neighborhood Commissions (ANCs), which are non-partisan entities that advise the city government on neighborhood issues.<br><br>

                    If you live in the Mount Vernon area, like I do, you are most likely part of Ward 6, ANC 6E. Each ANC is further divided into “Single Member Districts,” which each elect one Commissioner to represent them at the ANC. If you live in district 6E05, I am running to represent you.<br><br>
